# Price Prediction Challenge

In this project, you are given a dataset of real-estate properties, and we ask you to develop code that predicts the list price of a property. You should have in mind that the price of each property may change a lot given its region, and your solution should take that into account (try some feature engineering).
For the solution, we request that you build at least 2 models for price prediction, and after evaluating each model, you should compare them to choose the best one for the task (use the mean absolute percentage error for comparison).

## Step by Step
* Understanding the dataset
* Filter the dataset, remove unused, inconsistent and outliers values.
* Visualizing the dataset
* Choose 4 models from different categories 
* Evaluation of models
* Conclusion

## Run

Please use Jupiter Notebook (price_prediction_challenge.ipynb) with explanation and complete code. 
The file in the html version (price_prediction_challenge.html) can also be used to read the methodology, contains the graphics but can not execute the code.
